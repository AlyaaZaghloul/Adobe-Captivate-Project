# Adobe Captivate Project

## 📂 Project Structure

* `project.cptx` → Main Captivate project file (open in Adobe Captivate).
* `project.cptx.bak` → Backup file (optional).
* `index.html` → Start file for the published version (open in browser).
* `assets/` → Media files used in the project (images, audio, etc.).
* `vr/`, `dr/`, `callees/`, `ar/` → Additional folders required for published output.
* `css/`, `js/` → Styling and scripts for the HTML5 version.

## ▶️ How to Run

* To **view the project**:
  Open `index.html` from the published folder in your browser.

* To **edit the project**:
  Open `project.cptx` in Adobe Captivate.

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Adobe Captivate (to open/edit `.cptx` file).
* Any modern browser (to run the HTML output).

## ✨ Notes

* The `.bak` file is just a backup; you can ignore it if you only want to view the project.
* Make sure all folders (`vr`, `dr`, `callees`, `ar`, `assets`) stay in the same structure so the project works correctly.
